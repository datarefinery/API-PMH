# API-PMH

API-PMH is a proposal for implementing a 'protocol for metadata harvesting', inspired by [OAI-PMH](http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/), using current technology 'stacks' & practices, including:

* JSON data by default
* REST API (based on 'best practices' including usual HTTP requests/responses, mime types, and sequencing/paging)
* to be streaming capable

The rationale is to create a harvesting API which is simple to:
* implement
* use/consume 

over either:
* traditional data stores (SQL), or
* JSON document stores/indexers.
