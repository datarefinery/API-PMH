# API-PMH

API-PMH is a proposal for implementing a 'protocol for metadata harvesting', inspired by [OAI-PMH](http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/), using current technology practices, including:

* JSON data by default (but of course XML should be possible)
* REST API (based on current practices of adhering to 'proper' HTTP requests/responses, mime types, and sequencing/paging practices)
* to be streaming capable

The rationale is to create a harvesting API which is simple to implement and use/consume for both traditional data stores and, more importantly, for the current generation of JSON document oriented data stores/indexers.
